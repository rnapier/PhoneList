Exploring generic view controllers.

The basic idea of this sketch is there are two tabs with very duplicative requirements: a table view showing cells for some type, and an "add" screen to add that type. Extracts a generic ListViewController to handle that.

(Family is just a similar-but-but different data structure; not currently implemented, but is intended to be "almost the same but Family" compared to Contact.)
